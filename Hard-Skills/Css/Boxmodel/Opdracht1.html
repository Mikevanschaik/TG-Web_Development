        If a box has an outer display type of block, it will behave in the
        following ways: <br/><br />

        The box will break onto a new line. The box will extend in the inline
        direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases
        this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up
        100% of the space available. The width and height properties are
        respected. Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be
        pushed away from the box Some HTML elements, such as h1 and p, use block
        as their outer display type by default. <br/><br />

        If a box has an outer display type of inline, then: <br/>

        The box will not break onto a new line. The width and height properties
        will not apply. Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but
        will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box. Horizontal
        padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline
        boxes to move away from the box.
